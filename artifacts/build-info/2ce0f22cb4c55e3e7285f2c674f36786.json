This means that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}. For a generic mechanism see {ERC20Mintable}. * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification. * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances.

This means\nthat a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.\nFor a generic mechanism see {ERC20Mintable}.\n * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide\nhttps://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How\nto implement supply mechanisms].\n * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead\nof returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional\nand does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.\n * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\nThis allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\nby listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\nthese events, as it isn't required by the specification.\n * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}\nfunctions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\nallowances.

This can be worked around by making\nthose functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry\npoints to them.\n * TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways\nto protect against it, check out our blog post\nhttps://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul].\n * _Since v2.5.0:_ this module is now much more gas efficient, given net gas\nmetering changes introduced in the Istanbul hardfork.",
